# Martingale Python Bot

This python script was implemented for a specific virtual money online casino to test the validity of the Martingale betting scheme [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system) ]. The script uses the specified mathematical algorithm and image detection to find out what was the result of the bet and what should the next bet be. It only requires a single input from the user to start the program and then it can play by itself until stopped or until losing all "money".
